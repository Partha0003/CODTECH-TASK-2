OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
This Java program is a Student Grade Tracker that allows users to input their semester grades for various subjects and calculates their overall Grade Point Average (GPA) and corresponding letter grade.

The key features of this program are:

Storing the semester grades in a HashMap, where the subject name is the key and the grade is the value.
Calculating the total grade by summing up all the grades and then dividing by the number of subjects to get the GPA.
Determining the letter grade based on the calculated GPA using predefined grade thresholds.
Displaying the student's semester performance, including the GPA and letter grade.
The program uses a simple command-line interface, where the user is prompted to enter the subject name and grade, and can exit the input loop to see the final results.
